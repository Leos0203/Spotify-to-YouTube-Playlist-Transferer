# Spotify-to-YouTube-Playlist-Transferer
The main point of this app is to connect to your Spotify Account so it can get a playlist of your choice, get the songs and then transfer them to your YouTube account
The playlist will have the exact same name and description
This app uses the YouTube and Spotify API to access all of the necessary information.
Uppon launching the youtube.py file you will be asked to give some information necessary for logging into your accounts
Afterwards you will need to provide a Spotify playlist ID
The app will take care of the rest

Important to note is uppon giving the needed information for the APIs the app will save in the same directory files with the extension .pickle which will contain data so next time you use the app you won't need to give the same information
You will only be asked to give a Spotify playlist ID

This is my first actual project, I'm new to this so any feedback and help will be greatly appreciated!
