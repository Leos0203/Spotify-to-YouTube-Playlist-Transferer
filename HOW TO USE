To use this app there a couple of things that need to be done before running the app

1. Download the files
First download the files (youtube.py / spotify.py)

2. Set up YouTube API
Afterwards you will need to go to 'console.cloud.google.com'
There you will need to create a new project
You will then need to enable the YouTube Data API
Then go to Credentials
Create Credentials -> API Key
Save it as you will need it later
Then go to Create Credentials -> OAuth client ID
if this is your first time doing this you wll need to configure a consent screen
just click "external
put in an Application name and click save
go back to credentials
Now go back to credentials and click Create Credentials -> OAuth client ID
Now for the Application type choose Web application
Give it a name
In the Authorized redirect URIs click add URL
since we're doing this locally do http://localhost:8080
and go ahead and create
now it's gonnna display our client ID and secret but unlike the API Key we will not be copying them
click ok
and at the OAuth 2.0 Client IDs in the Credentials Tab you will see the OAuth we just created
to the right there will be a download button which will give us a file and save us time later on
copy and paste it into the directory and rename it to "client_secrets.json"

3. Set Up Spotify API
Now the heavy lifting is done
all we need to do is go to "https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard" and log into your profile
Click on "Create an App"
Give it a App name
and at the Redirect URI we will use "redirect_uri = "https://google.com""
click "I understand and agree with Spotify's Developer Terms of Service and Design Guidelines"
Now your app is done
all you need to do is go to Settings
and copy your Client ID
Then Click view Client Secret and copy it too

4. Pip install needed libraries
If you haven't installed the Google API libraries and Spotipy, install them as they are needed

5. Starting the program
After the first launch you will be asked to enter your Spotify Client ID and Secret
After entering you will be redirected to a google.com page to verify you
All you need to do is copy the URL which is going to be very long and paste it into the terminal where it will ask you for this link
After this you won't be asked again
You will also be asked to provide a Spotify Playlist ID which can be gotten from the link of a Spotify playlist
Then you will be asked for your YouTube API Key
You will be asked to log into your account
Just choose the account and if you are getting an error
Go to 'console.cloud.google.com' -> OAuth Consent Screen
Scroll down and you'll see "Test Users"
just add your email adress and it should work fine
Since we are using the YouTube secret file instead of copying the Secret and ID the program wil do it's thing and log you in
After that all the needed information will be saved using pickle (a built in pyhthon library) as files with .pickle extension (they can also be read and printed using pickle)
Now unless the Refresh Token is not valid you will be able to log in every time without having to do all of this

Thank you for trying out my program. This is my first project and I'm new to this so any feedback is appriciated!
